                Their first appearance was in HollowKnight as a boss battle. She fights with a needle and is the daughter of the Pale King and Herrah the Beast. She was born as a bargaining 
                chip for her mother and as such did not spend much time with her. Hornet survived the Infection and the fall of the kingdom. She wanders its ruins, chasing off travelers who 
                would seek to desecrate them.
